# Instacart
The Instacart stakeholders are most interested in the variety of customers in their database
along with their purchasing behaviors. With their advertisments, they would like to target specific groups
in their customer pool.  They want to target different customers with applicable marketing campaigns to see whether they have an effect on the sale
of their products.
Instacart wanted to uncover more information about their sales patterns. I have perform an initial data and exploratory
analysis of some of their data in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria.
